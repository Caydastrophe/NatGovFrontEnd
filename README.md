#NOTE
I'm not finished with the project, there are still security features I want to add and polish out the ui.

#The Setup
Cloning the project from Git
To pull code from a Git repository into Visual Studio using the terminal, you can follow these steps:

1) Open the terminal and run: git clone <link>
2) Install the dependancies
   
   --node modules
   • npm install 
   
   --ssl certificate
    open powerShell
    • Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    (close and re-open powershell)
    •choco install mkcert
    •mkcert localhost
    •mkcert -install

    Note: Replace {YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PATH} and {YOUR_KEY_PATH} with the your actual filepaths eg. C:\Windows\system32\localhost-key.pem.

    --flow

    • npm install --save flow-bin

    • "flow": "flow"

    • npm run flow init

    • // @flow

    -- react router dom

    • npm i react-router-dom



### The National Government's FrontEnd

The purpose of the FrontEnd is to allow for secure sign in, and then allow government workers to view posts on the bulletin boards, as well as securely create and delete their own posts on the boards. The app makes use of SSL certificates to secure the connection, bcrypt to hash and store passwords, JSON web token's to persist log-in state and caters for CORS. The front end allows users to do this by interacting with the web interface.

























































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
